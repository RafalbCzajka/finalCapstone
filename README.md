# Task 42: Capstone Project: Build a Complete Website

This project I applied my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge to create a website which meets a set of criteria.
The criteria of this task was:

	Within the entirety of your site, you should have the following JavaScript functionality:
	1. Create a functional “Save for later” page for your website, where users can earmark articles, images, recipes, etc. In a 
	personal folder to be able to go back and see them later.
	2. Each item/recipe/image, etc. must have the option to “Save for later”.
	3. When an item is added, an alert should tell the user how many items
	are in their “Save for later” folder.
	4. Create a new HTML page for the “Save for later” section, which allows
	the user to see what is in their folder.
	5. Create a form which allows a user to leave comments.
	6. Create forms to allow a user to “like” an item/article/etc.
	7. Create forms for if a person would like to contact you.
