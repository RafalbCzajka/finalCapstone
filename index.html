        <h2>What is Inktober?</h2>
        <p>Inktober is a month long art challenge created by artist <a href="https://www.mrjakeparker.com/" target="_blank">Jake Parker</a> that is focused on improving skill and developing positive drawing habits. Every day for the month of October anyone participating in the Inktober challenge creates a ink drawing or digital artwork related to a prompt for each day. In 2022 I made my first attempt at this daily drawing challenge and I have created this website to showcase my own drawings. Unfortunately as this was my first attempt at something like this, I wasn't able to complete the whole challenge, but I enjoyed taking part and trying out different techniques each day to try and improve my skills.</p>

        <h2>Why did I take part?</h2>
        <p>Despite not being an artist myself, I decided to take part in Inktober 2022 for multiple reasons, the main reason was because at the time it sounded like a fun idea as I have never attempted any daily challenge of this nature before and I was curious how far I would be able to go. Another reason however was because I enjoy developing skills and I know that daily practice was a very effective method of doing this, by trying it on something I wasn't good at to begin with I gave myself more room to learn and I could see results of daily practice faster. This experience also taught me about how time consuming creating art can be.</p>
